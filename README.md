# The Map Group

This is the code repository for the [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com)'s group [**The Map Group**](https://www.flickr.com/groups/the-map-group/).

The group's purpose is to generate maps for the members, containing their geo-tagged photos, and also a map for the group itself, containing the photos posted to the [group's pool](https://www.flickr.com/groups/the-map-group/pool/), by members or by owners of invited photos.

### Group's Map

The group's map contains a panel with links to each member's _Flickr_ photostream and shows the number of markers and photos that he or she added to the group.
Clicking on a marker it is possible to see the photo(s) taken on the corresponding location. Clicking on the photo thumbnail opens the photo's page on _Flickr_.

### Member's Map

The member's maps contain a panel with a list of all the countries where the member have taken photos and uploaded to _Flickr_. Clicking on the country makes the map zoom to it.
The markers have the same behaviour of the group's map.
